milestone_cameras_state.py
--------------------------
One-shot fetcher for Milestone XProtect cameras with their parent
hardware data (most importantly, the IP/network address).

Why this script exists:
    The cameras returned by /api/rest/v1/cameras don't carry the IP
    address — that lives on the parent hardware object. Per Milestone
    engineering guidance on the developer forum, the recommended bulk
    pattern is:
        GET /api/rest/v1/hardware?includeChildren=cameras
    which returns every hardware record together with its child
    cameras in a single call. We then flatten that tree into a flat
    list of camera records, each carrying its parent hardware's
    address/name/id/model.

    Doing this in Python (rather than a Zabbix Script item with JS) gives:
      - structured logging
      - testability with --dry-run
      - graceful handling of paginated responses
      - URL-to-IP normalisation in real Python rather than embedded JS
      - identical operational pattern (refresh.sh writes file,
        read.sh cats file) as milestone_ess_state.py

Output (default):
    JSON keyed by camera GUID:
        {
          "count": N,
          "fetched_at": "2026-04-29T12:34:56Z",
          "cameras": {
              "<camera-guid>": {
                  "id": "<camera-guid>",
                  "displayName": "Front door cam",
                  "enabled": true,
                  "address": "10.172.18.79",            # bare host
                  "mac": "00:40:8C:F3:46:C9",           # normalized
                  "macRaw": "00408CF346C9",             # as Milestone stores it
                  "hardwareId": "<hw-guid>",
                  "hardwareName": "AXIS-encoder-01",
                  "hardwareModel": "AXIS Q7411",
                  "relations": {...},                    # full original record
                  ...
              },
              ...
          }
        }

The MAC address lives on the parent hardware as a "hardware setting" named
MacAddress, not as a top-level hardware property. We try to pull it inline
via includeChildren=cameras,settings; if the API version doesn't expose it
that way, we fall back to per-hardware GET /hardware/{id}/settings calls,
parallelized with a small thread pool. Use --no-mac to skip MAC enrichment
entirely if the extra round-trips are unwelcome.

Usage:

                              [--no-mac] [--mac-workers 8]

Exit codes:
